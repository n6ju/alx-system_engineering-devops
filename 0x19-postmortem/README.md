**Issue Summary:**

**Duration:** july 19, 2023, 09:32 AM to july 19, 2023, 11:45 AM (UTC)

**Impact:** The user authentication service experienced an outage during the specified duration. Users attempting to log in were unable to access their accounts, resulting in a 32% decrease in user activity across the platform.

**Root Cause:** The outage was caused by a misconfigured load balancer that inadvertently blocked incoming traffic to the authentication servers.

**Timeline:**

- **09:32 AM:** Issue detected as a sudden drop in user logins was observed in the system metrics.
- **09:40 AM:** Monitoring alerts triggered, indicating a spike in server errors and increased response times for authentication requests.
- **09:45 AM:** Engineers initiated investigation, suspecting potential database overload or network issues.
- **10:15 AM:** Assumption made that the database was causing the issue due to high CPU utilization; database team started investigating.
- **10:45 AM:** Database team identified no significant issues on the database side, ruling it out as the root cause.
- **11:00 AM:** Engineering team identified discrepancies in load balancer logs, hinting at misconfigurations.
- **11:15 AM:** Incident escalated to infrastructure team for load balancer investigation.
- **11:30 AM:** Load balancer misconfiguration confirmed, causing a blockage of incoming requests to authentication servers.
- **11:45 AM:** Misconfiguration fixed, and load balancer services were fully restored, resolving the authentication outage.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the issue was identified as a misconfigured load balancer. The load balancer's access control lists were incorrectly set, causing it to block incoming traffic from certain IP ranges, including those from the authentication servers.

**Resolution:** The issue was resolved by adjusting the access control lists on the load balancer to allow incoming traffic from the authentication servers. Once the misconfiguration was corrected, the load balancer began routing incoming requests to the authentication servers as intended.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

**Improvements/Fixes:**
1. **Load Balancer Configuration Review:** Conduct a thorough review of all load balancer configurations to ensure they align with the intended routing rules.
2. **Automated Monitoring:** Implement automated monitoring that alerts engineers in real-time when load balancer traffic patterns deviate from the norm.
3. **Redundancy and Failover Testing:** Set up redundancy and failover mechanisms for the authentication service to minimize downtime during similar incidents.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**
1. **Load Balancer Audit:** Conduct a comprehensive audit of all load balancers to identify any further misconfigurations and correct them promptly.
2. **Documentation Update:** Update the load balancer configuration documentation to ensure future engineers have accurate information.
3. **Regular Load Testing:** Regularly perform load testing on the authentication service to identify potential bottlenecks and capacity limitations.

By addressing the misconfigured load balancer and implementing preventative measures, we aim to enhance the reliability and availability of our user authentication service.
